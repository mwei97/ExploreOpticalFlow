# ExploreOpticalFlow

HarrisCorner.py and ShiTomasi.py are scripts to detect and mark corners in image.

OF_PyrLK.py is the feature optical flow computation implementation based on Lucas-Kanade method.

OF_DualTVL1.py and OF_Farneback.py are scripts to calculate dense optical flow in two different functions.

DualTVL1.py and Farneback.py are scripts to process videos and compute and save optical flow so as to be passed into the evaluate model.
